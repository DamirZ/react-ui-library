# react-ui-library

React based UI component library for showcasing react, webpack, storybook and using this library in other projects after build process.

## Getting started

First you need to install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

After installation run Storybook for the UI library

```bash
npm run-script storybook
```

Follow the link on terminal to access the storybook - default is http://localhost:9009/.

## What is this project?

This is a simple react-based UI library with only 2 inputs to showcase my ability to work with React, webpack, storybook and making a project that is ready to be included in other projects.

## How to use storybook to check options?

After you use 

```bash
npm run-script storybook
```

go to the link in terminal. On the left sidebar you will have 2 components with different options showed. You can change options and interact with the components using "KNOBS" inputs on the bottom part of the screen. Try editing or removing some texts or checking/unchecking some options. 

To check how to use the components click "Show Info" in upper right corner of the screen.
